## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
In doing this challenge, I had a basic understanding of HTML, CSS flexbox and media queries.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build the design image displayed in the design folder.


## My users are able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

All the required assets used are in the /images folder. The assets were already optimized.

## Building the project

 In building this projet, I used;
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS custom properties
 - Flexbox


## Deploying the project

I deployed the project using netlify, from my Github account.
